- Pydantic models for all major entities (Contest, Team, Submission, etc.)
- Simple, unified client interface (`DOMJudge`)
- Supports authentication, file uploads, and more
- Designed for scripting, automation, and integration

## Planned / To Do

- Add more automatic tests and CI integration
- Expand documentation and usage examples
- Add more API endpoint coverage as DOMJudge evolves
- Improve error handling and type hints

```bash
pip install pydomjudge
```
Or clone this repository and install locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xivqn/pydomjudge.git

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [DOMJudge](https://www.domjudge.org/) instance (for API access)
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies

## Usage Example

```python
from pydomjudge import DOMJudge

dj = DOMJudge("http://localhost/domjudge", "admin", "adminpass")

    print(contest.name, contest.start_time)
```
